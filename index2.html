        <h1>Why Should You Play Hollow Knight? (continued)</h1>
        <div class="div">
            <p>Fast-paced combat, tons of gear and collectables, and more bosses than you'll probably ever beat. These are the bread and butter of Hollow Knight's gameplay. It is a bit on the difficult side, but once you can get a grasp of the controls, it's fun just to control your character. The music, the characters, the lore, the gameplay, the backgrounds, everything combines into what is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. And I will always attempt to get more people to experience it for themselves</p>
